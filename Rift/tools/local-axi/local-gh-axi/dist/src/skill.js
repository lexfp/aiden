# gh-axi

${DESCRIPTION}

You do not need gh-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y gh-axi <command>\`.
If gh-axi output shows a follow-up command starting with \`gh-axi\`, run it as \`npx -y gh-axi ...\` instead.

gh-axi requires the [\`gh\`](https://cli.github.com/) CLI installed and authenticated (\`gh auth login\`). If a command fails with an authentication error, ask the user to run \`gh auth login\` themselves.

## When to use

Use gh-axi whenever a task touches GitHub: listing, filing, or editing issues; viewing, creating, reviewing, or merging pull requests; inspecting workflow runs and CI failures; managing releases, repositories, or labels; searching issues, PRs, repos, commits, or code; or calling the GitHub API directly.

## Workflow

1. Run \`npx -y gh-axi\` with no arguments for a dashboard of the current repo - open issues, open PRs, and suggested next commands.
2. Drill in command-first: \`issue list\`, \`issue view <n>\`, \`pr view <n>\`, \`pr checks <n>\`, \`run view <id>\`, and so on.
3. Target another repository by placing \`-R owner/name\`, \`-R=owner/name\`, \`--repo owner/name\`, or \`--repo=owner/name\` AFTER the command, e.g. \`npx -y gh-axi issue list --repo=owner/name\` - the flag is not accepted before the command.
4. Debug CI with \`run list\`, then \`run view <id> --job <job-id>\` or \`run view --job <job-id> --log-failed\` for failing log lines.
   Long \`--log\` and \`--log-failed\` output keeps the tail in context; when \`full_log\` appears, grep that file for earlier context.
5. Every response ends with contextual next-step hints under \`help:\` - follow them.

## Commands

\`\`\`
${extractCommandsBlock()}
\`\`\`

Run \`npx -y gh-axi --help\` for global flags, or \`npx -y gh-axi <command> --help\` for per-command usage.

## Tips

- Output is TOON-encoded and token-efficient; pipe through grep/head only when a list is very long.
- Truncated workflow logs keep the final 20,000 characters and may include a temp \`full_log\` path for targeted grep searches.
- Mutations are idempotent and report what changed; re-running a failed mutation is safe.
- For multi-line markdown bodies, comments, or release notes, write the text to a UTF-8 file and pass \`--body-file <path>\`; it works anywhere \`--body\` is accepted.
- Use \`api\` for anything the dedicated commands do not cover, e.g. \`npx -y gh-axi api repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics\`.
